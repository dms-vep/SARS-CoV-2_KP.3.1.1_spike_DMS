This page provides access to interactive visualizations of the effects of mutations to the spike of the KP.3.1.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 as measured using [pseudovirus deep mutational scanning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867423001034).
The study that generated these data is detailed in **Add link to preprint/paper**, which is also the citation for these data.

The measurements were all made using non-replicative lentiviral pseudotyped particles ("pseudoviruses") that are not infectious pathogens capable of causing disease, and so provide a safe way to study the impact of mutations to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

The links in the gray boxes above take you to pages with details about the experimental measurements of the effects of mutations on different spike phenotypes, as well as interactive visualizations and links to the numerical measurements for each mutation.

For the full computer code and numerical results, see the GitHub repo at [https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_KP.3.1.1_spike_DMS](https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_KP.3.1.1_spike_DMS).
For full documentation of the analysis pipeline, see the [Appendix](appendix.html){target="_self"}.
