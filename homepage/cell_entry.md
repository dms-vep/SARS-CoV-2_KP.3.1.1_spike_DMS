# Cell Entry in 293T-ACE2 cells

Effects of mutations in spike on entry in 293T cells expressing ACE2. Effects greater than zero (blue) indicate a mutation improves cell entry while effects less than zero (orange) indicate a mutation impairs cell entry. X indicates the wild-type amino acid in KP.3.1.1. Light grey indicates mutations for which effects were not measured in our libraries; note that our library design excluded most mutations expected to be highly deleterious from all regions of the spike except for the RBD. For these measurements medium ACE2 cells were used, these cells are described in [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/9/2061).
